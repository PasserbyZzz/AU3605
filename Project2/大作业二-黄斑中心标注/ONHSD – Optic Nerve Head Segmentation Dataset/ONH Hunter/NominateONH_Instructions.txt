Using the ONH Markup Program
============================

Installing
----------

Copy the entire contents of the CD to a directory on the hard
disk. This includes the image set and the MATLAB code.

The markup program
------------------

There is a separate program each for Ansu and Bob.
To run Ansu's version, type:

> AnsuONH

at the MATLAB prompt. That allows you to markup all
the images. To markup just a single one, type e.g.

> AnsuONH( 1 ) 

to do the first one. To do a range (say 3-7 inclusive):

> AnsuONH( 3:7 )

To run Bob's version, use "BobONH" instead of "AnsuONH".

When the program runs, you see the image to be marked up.
There are lines radiating from the estimated ONH
centre (which may be wrong - don't worry about that). You need 
to click on the point where each radial line crosses the ONH
rim. When you do that, a cyan marker is shown. You can click again
if you misplace one, and can do them in any order.

If you want to see what the image looks like without the lines on
it, click in the left or top margin of the image window (i.e. outside
the image itself, on the grey background area). This will toggle the
display of the lines on and off, so click a second time to redisplay the
lines. This can be quite helpful in deciding exactly where the edge is.

When you have finished an image, press the <RETURN> key. The program will
then display the next image in the sequence.

If you get prematurely bored, you can press CTRL+C to end the program.
This won't do any harm, except for losing the results of the last image -
any previous ones are unaffected.

You can run the program again as many times as you like. To review results,
just run it and press <RETURN> without altering the position of any of the 
edge lines.

Some images cannot be processed. This includes: images with cataract, images
where the centre point is outside the ONH, images where the centre point is
so close to the edge of the ONH that, even though it is inside, its impossible
to mark up. You should ignore all these images (just press <RETURN> to move
onto the next one).

Guessing
--------

The objective of the exercise is to find out how consistent the algorithm is
with human expertise. Therefore, don't worry if you can't see the edge on
some spokes, or think the position is ill-defined - just use your best-guess.
The algorithm will have to do the same, and we will assess its performance
according to its consistency with our expert human guessers. The amount of
variation between your expert opinions on the edge location will also help
to quantify how uncertain the edge position is.
